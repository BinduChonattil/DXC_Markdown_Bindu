# TIPS AND TRICKS OF TECHNICAL WRITING

## OVERVIEW

What is Technical Writing? In simple words, it is the art of creating and communicating information to specifically targeted audiences through simple and concise language. Technical documentation can embrace a variety of domains. This includes Information Technology, Marketing, Aviation, Engineering, finance, and much more.

## HOW TO BECOME A SUCCESSFUL TECHNICAL WRITER?

To a great extent, the complexity of technical writing abides in the type of domain the Writer is associated with. However, there are some tips and tricks all technical writers can get accustomed to, in order to create a purposeful document. 

**1. Follow Document Development Life Cycle (DDLC):**

DDLC is the process of planning, analyzing, designing, creating, editing, publishing and maintaining a document during the entire product development lifecycle. A comprehensive understanding of the document development Life Cycle can help the writers to analyze the project requirement, plan ahead and thus meet design specifications in the creation of a purposeful document.

**2. Adapting a simple, Precise Style of Writing:**

The main objective of Technical writing is to break the complex technical information into simple, clear and easy to understand text. The simpler the details are, the easier it is to comprehend.

**3. Identification of Audience:**

Audience analysis is an integral part of technical writing. A document targeted towards specifically set audience can render more knowledge and information.

**4. Identification of Scope:**

It’s hard to create a technical documentation without understanding the scope. This again can be tagged back to the importance of planning and analyzing time required for technical documentation.

**5.Good Knowledge of Graphic Designing Tools:**   

Graphic can be a useful tool, especially rendering technical information. Visual images can create more impact than readable contents. There are multitudes of graphic designing and screen capturing tools like the following:

* MS Visio:

PS: Code Block Example:
```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```
 
```
No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting. 
But let's throw in a <b>Code Block Example for DXC Test</b>.
```
